## üöÄ Project Overview
This project develops a **Next Word Prediction model** using **LSTM networks**.  
Given a sequence of words, the model predicts the most probable next word. We use Shakespeare's *Hamlet* as the dataset for training, providing rich and complex language patterns.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time next-word predictions via a Streamlit web app.
- LSTM-based deep learning architecture.
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting.

## üóÇ Dataset
- **Source:** Shakespeare's *Hamlet*
- **Type:** Text corpus
- **Preprocessing:** 
  - Tokenization
  - Sequence generation
  - Padding to ensure uniform input length

---

## üèó Model Architecture
- **Embedding Layer:** Converts words to dense vectors.
- **Two LSTM Layers:** For sequence learning and context capture.
- **Dense Output Layer:** Softmax activation to predict probabilities of next word.
